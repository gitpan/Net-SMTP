This is the README file for Net::SMTP

This module implements a client interface to the SMTP protocol, enabling
a perl5 application to talk to SMTP servers. The documentation assumes
that you are familiar with the SMTP protocol described in RFC821.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
